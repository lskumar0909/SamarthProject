    <h1>About Lego</h1>

<h2>
    Lego is an interactive toy for all ages and is very fun to play with. Lego is very <br> popular all around the world
    and you can make whatever you want. You can also buy lego sets which have a lego structure and some lego figures.<br><br>

    The lego group was founded in 1932 by Ola Kirk Kristiansen. It started off as a normal lego company <br> and became
    one of the most famous toy manufacturers in the world. Amazingly, LEGO produces 318 plastic tires a year.<br>
    When the Lego Minifigure was introduced in 1975, the company wanted the builders to project their imaginations onto faceless figures.
    A team of ambitious builders decided to build a 112-foot tower out of Lego bricks. <br> They were put into a 
    world records book. The name lego came from the first two letters of the Danish <br> word Leg and Godt meaning
    play well. Did you know that there are around 400 billion <br> Lego bricks around the world? If you were to stack all of these Legos together, this tower would 2,386,065 miles (3,839,999 kilometers)  tall. 
    This <br> meaning that it would stretch ten times farther than the distance to the moon.  A British man named Hilary Fisher Page (1904-1957) invented a self-locking brick that was a predecessor to Lego. 
    The Lego bricks were based on these. <br> The first Lego blocks were patented in 1949.
